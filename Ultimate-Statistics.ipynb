    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "All conclusions were reached by running simulations with one million throws. Teams were always composed of three handlers and four cutters, with **two male handlers and one female handler**, and the other four players (two female and two male) are cutters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment1: \n",
    "* If throws were purely random and positions were meaningless, female receivers (or, really, the gender with 3 players) would receive 43% of passes, while male receivers (or the gender with 4 players) would receive 57% of passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A assuming two player positions (cutters and handlers) and cutters always threw to handlers and vice versa, females are expected to receive ~42% of passes to ~58% for males. This is a **negligable change from Experiment 1, or a purely random team**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assumming that handlers always received 2/3 of passes, regardless of who the thrower was, females are expected to receive ~39% of passes and males ~61% of passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assuming an **extreme scenario where handlers always received 90% of passes**, regardless of who the thrower was, females are expected to receive ~35% of passes and males ~65%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assuming that a team has a dominant male handler that always receives half the throws from their teammates, along with one other male handler and one female handler, the females are expected to receive ~33% of passes and males ~67%. If the dominant male handler gets every other throw (so, is thrown to every time by his teammates), then we recover 25% usage statistics for females and 75% for males overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, assuming that the majority of teams play 3:4 female-male with two male and one female handlers, it is likely that the results observed in the ultiworld article are a measurement of a throwing bias. That is, in the context of the five experiments shown here, the article **likely did observe a trend where players tended to not throw to female players**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative explainations that would involve no throwing bias might include:\n",
    "* Teams ran lots of all male handler lines, possibly suggesting intrinsic, tactical reasons to play males at handler positions in mixed games (possible, but unlikely).\n",
    "* The players observed in the article have vast skill differences between genders (again, possible, but unlikely given that this is nationals).\n",
    "* The plays or strategies that teams ran under(over) utilized the female(male) players, meaning there is a 'strategic bias' rather than a throwing bias.\n",
    "* Mixed play in general allows for defensive strategies that makes it more difficult for females to get open. For instnace, help defense may be easier to execute against female cutters. This is somewhat likely, but is difficult to test in a simulation, and would be much easier to investigate by looking at tape."
